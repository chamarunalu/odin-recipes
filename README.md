# odin-recipes

This is a basic HTML project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. The purpose of this project is to build a simple recipe website using only HTML.

## Project Description

The website consists of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes headings, paragraphs, images, and lists. The goal is to practice writing semantic HTML and structuring a multi-page website.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have:

- Learned how to create and structure HTML documents.
- Used elements like `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`â€“`<h6>`, and `<p>`.
- Practiced creating internal links between multiple HTML files.
- Improved my understanding of semantic HTML and document structure.
- Gained experience organizing files and folders in a basic web project.

This project is a foundation for learning more advanced web development topics like CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design in the future.
