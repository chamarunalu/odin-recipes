    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy pizza dough recipe is great for beginners and produces 2 soft and chewy homemade pizza crusts.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the dough:</b> Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
        <li><b>Knead:</b> Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand. If you're new to yeasted doughs, my How to Knead Dough post and video can help with this step.</li>
        <li><b>Rise:</b> Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li><b>Punch & shape:</b> Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
        <li><b>Top it:</b> Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
        <li><b>Bake:</b> Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
